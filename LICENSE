Inclusive growth
"I actively promote and contribute to an inclusive and diverse work environment by fostering a culture of respect, empathy, and open communication. Recently, I addressed a sensitive situation where a colleague's behavior was impacting teamwork. After unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue directly, I discovered that the behavior was related to personal harassment. Recognizing the severity, I promptly escalated the matter to our Dev Lead and Manager. Their swift intervention ensured a resolution, maintaining a safe and respectful workplace. This experience reinforced the importance of proactive allyship and supportive leadership in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Through such initiatives, I strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to succeed."

RISK

"During PR reviews, I identified a potential risk in a merged code change from another team's repository. The implementation lacked proper feature flag protection, exposing the unfinished feature to all users instead of the intended pilot group. I promptly alerted the developer, who reverted the changes before production deployment, preventing unintended feature exposure and avoiding an unnecessary hotfix. This proactive escalation demonstrated my attention to detail, risk awareness, and collaborative approach to ensuring secure and controlled deployments."

Or, if you'd like a shorter version:

"While reviewing PRs, I spotted a merged code change lacking feature flag protection, risking unintended exposure. I swiftly alerted the developer, who reverted the changes pre-deployment, preventing unnecessary hotfixes and ensuring controlled feature rollouts."

Development

To further enhance my impact, I'm focusing on expanding my skill set and expertise in key areas. Firstly, I aim to develop my soft skills, particularly influence and negotiation, to effectively communicate technical ideas and drive consensus in meetings. This will enable me to collaborate more effectively with cross-functional teams and stakeholders. Additionally, I'm eager to broaden my technical expertise by diving deeper into backend development, specifically Java, to become proficient in full-stack development. By acquiring these skills, I'll increase my versatility, tackle complex projects, and contribute more comprehensively to our team's success.

Or, if you'd like a shorter version:

I'm committed to professional growth, focusing on two key areas: soft skills and technical expertise. I aim to develop influence and negotiation skills to effectively communicate in meetings and drive consensus. Additionally, I'll explore Java backend development to become proficient in full-stack development, enhancing my versatility and contributions to the team.
